A WordPress search plugin with live and voice search. 

== Description ==

**Instant Search** is a WordPress plugin that offers both live search (typing) and live voice search which is great for accessibility, making it easier for everyone to use.

Click [this icon](https://instant-search.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/icon-settings.png) to access the settings page. 

Use the shortcode `[instant_search]` to display a search form anywhere.
